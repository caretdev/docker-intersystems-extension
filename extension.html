  This provides a new distribution channel for customers to access container-based releases and previews. All Community
  Edition images are available in a public repository with no login required. All full released images (IRIS, IRIS for
  Health, Health Connect, System Alerting and Monitoring, InterSystems Cloud Manager) and utility images (such as
  arbiter, Web Gateway, and PasswordHash) require a login token, generated from your WRC (Worldwide Response Center)
  account credentials.
